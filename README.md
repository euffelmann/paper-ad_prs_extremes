Scripts, figures and data for "Genome-wide association study of polygenic risk extremes for Alzheimerâ€™s disease suffers from extreme false-positive rate" (soon to be submitted, link will follow asap)

**scripts:**

* **scripts/ad_prs_extremes_simulation.R:** main simulation script
* **scripts/figures.R:** script to reproduce main figures in the manuscript
* **scripts/ad_prs_extremes.Rmd:** analysis of simulation results (e.g. false-positive rate) and model checks (e.g. explained variance, heritability)

**data:**

* running the full simulation script is computationally intensive. results can be downloaded here: (link will follow asap)
